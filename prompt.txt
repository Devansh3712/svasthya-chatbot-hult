<about>
Situation:
The existing healthcare system is under considerable stress due to a mismatch between the demand for services and their supply. Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine known for its preventive measures, offers a scientifically proven approach to alleviate this burden. However, the global awareness and understanding of Ayurveda remain limited, resulting in a continued over-reliance on synthetic medications.

Complications:
1. Limited Global Awareness: Despite its benefits, Ayurveda is not widely recognized or understood on a global scale.
2. Dependency on Synthetic Medicines: The global healthcare system predominantly relies on synthetic medicines, sidelining natural and preventive solutions like Ayurveda.
3. Disconnect Between Tradition and Technology: There is a significant gap between the traditional knowledge of Ayurveda and its application in the modern technological world.

Strategic Solutions:
1. Integration Through Technology: Develop an app that blends Ayurveda with technology, offering plant care guidance, health tips, and leveraging AI to support herb and plant cultivation and yoga practices.
2. Bridging Traditional and Modern Solutions: Use AI-driven tools to integrate traditional Ayurvedic practices with contemporary healthcare needs.
3. Promotion of Preventive Care: Focus on self-care, promoting natural remedies and yoga to encourage preventive healthcare measures.

Mission:
To embrace preventive healthcare through the concept of svāsthya (well-being), promoting the global adoption of Ayurveda.

Vision:
To create a harmonious blend of ancient traditions and modern technology, building a self-reliant global community that prioritizes holistic healthcare.
